In Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad a sailor named Marlow gives a narrative in which he recalls his experience in Africa as a steam boat captain for an imperialist trading company. He tells of a journey on the Congo river to retrieve Kurtz, the company's top agent. Upon reaching Kurtz's home, Marlow discovers human heads mounted on posts. Marlow's monologue surrounding this finding provides connections to ideas implicit in his narrative as a whole.

After Marlow tells his audience what he had found outside of Kurtz's home he says, “I am not disclosing any trade secrets;" this statement, which is a reference to the confidentiality paperwork Marlow had signed earlier in his narrative, gives a connection to Marlow's beliefs about imperialism as a result of his experiences in Africa (53). The word “secrets" in Marlow's statement is clearly used to mean things that are hidden from the knowledge of others. The statement follows shortly after Marlow tells of his discovery of the human heads which confirm that Kurtz does not try to hide his savage ways in obtaining ivory. Kurtz overtly exposes the secret to his success and that of the company, namely the savage exploitation of native people. In telling of his discovery about Kurtz, Marlow leads the audience directly to the uncovering of the dark secret Kurtz himself openly exhibits. Ironically, after Marlow reveals Kurtz's public display of the often disguised or hidden savage methodology of profitable imperialism, he declares that he is not revealing any secrets. This suggests that he does not believe that he is exhibiting hidden knowledge despite that his confirmation of Kurtz's savagery provides a connection for his audience to the relationship between savagery and profits in imperialist expeditions. Although it seems that Marlow has contradicted himself, from his perspective, formed from his experiences in Africa, he believes the connection between profit and the savage exploitation of the natives displayed in Kurtz is mirrored throughout imperialism and thus nothing secret. Previously, Marlow reinforces this idea when after discovering the heads he says, “I was not as shocked as you may think“ (52). This scene, which would normally be very appalling, seemed to fit after everything Marlow had experienced.

The following statement offers a connection to the hypocrisy of the manager and imperialism in general: “In fact the manager said afterwards that Mr. Kurtz's methods had ruined the district" (53). The use of the phrase “in fact" here conveys that Marlow wishes to give additional credibility to his previous assertion that no trade secrets were being unveiled. He uses the manager as a source of authority in backing his point. Marlow cites that the manager later asserted that the methods used by Mr. Kurtz “had ruined the district." The word “ruined" is used to mean that something had been rendered valueless. Since the manager had declared that Kurtz's methods had left the district valueless, he is implying that Kurtz's methods were worthless. If Kurtz's ways were at one point a secret, the manager's words had destroyed the value of keeping them secret. A secret of no value to a company seeking profit is no longer a secret worth retaining. This works to reinforce Marlow's point. Also, this demonstrates the hypocrisy of the manager. Marlow gives many clues throughout his narrative that the manager feels threatened by Kurtz's success. The manager knows that Kurtz is the top agent and is such because of his methodology. However, because Kurtz does not disguise his techniques as others in the company do, the manger sees an easy way to discredit Kurtz. The manager makes it clear that Kurtz has gone outside his definition of acceptable behavior when he refers to Kurtz's method as “unsound" (57). The manager is quick to classify Kurtz as savage when in reality the actions and intentions of the manager are not any more civil than those of Kurtz. The imperialists like the manager are quick to label the natives as savage when their own actions are often less civil than those of the natives.

The statement in which Marlow says, “I have no opinion on that point, but I want you clearly to understand that there was nothing exactly profitable in these heads being there" provides a connection to the uncovering of the mystery behind Kurtz (53). Here Marlow starts by saying he has no opinion about what the manager had later said about Kurtz's method ruining the district. This allows him to divert attention from the manager. Marlow makes a direct address to his audience with the use of the word “you." Here he specifically goes outside his narrative to fully capture his audience's attention. Then he makes a point to convey that the heads outside of Kurtz's house were there for reasons outside of profit. Up until this point in Marlow's narrative only very subtle clues had been offered to dissolve the mystery around Kurtz. Here Marlow makes a goal to bring the attention of his audience to Kurtz. This represents a turning point in Marlow's narrative where from here on out there is a focus which largely revolves around unraveling the enigma surrounding Kurtz.

The following sentence supplies a connection to the idea of restraint and the slippery slope to savagery: “They only showed that Mr. Kurtz lacked restraint in the gratification of his various lusts, that there was something wanting in him—some small matter which when the pressing need arose, could not be found under his magnificent eloquence" (53). The word “they" is used to refer to the heads. Marlow starts by implying that the heads are nothing more than a symbol of Kurtz's inability to control his desires. He elaborates to add that the heads were the result of Kurtz giving in to one small desire at a time. This implies that one indulgence leads to another and and as a result all control is lost. Marlow then adds that Kurtz was not able to control himself even with his ability to influence everyone around him. This implies that despite one's power of influence over others, the ability to control oneself is entirely another matter.

A connection to the question of conscious knowledge of one's loss of self-control is made when Marlow says, “Whether he knew of this deficiency himself I can't say" (53). Here “knew" is used to mean aware. The “deficiency" in question is Kurtz's loss of control. Two possibilities exist concerning Kurt's deficiency. The first is that Kurtz was aware of his lost of control and was unable to regain control. The second is that he was unaware and did not try to regain control. Here Marlow asserts he is unable to determine which of these possibilities was truly the case; however, in the next sentence Marlow says, “I think the knowledge came to him at last—only at the very last" (53). Here Marlow is foreshadowing the description he later gives of Kurtz's death in which Kurt's final words are “The horror! The horror!" (64). Upon hearing Kurtz's final words Marrow infers that Kurtz had finally become aware that he had lost control.

The following statements make a connection to the lure of unrestricted fulfillment of desire and its effect on humanity: “But the wilderness had found him out early, and had taken on him a terrible vengeance for the fantastic invasion. I think it had whispered to him things about himself which he did not know, things of which he had no conception till he took counsel with this great solitude—and the whisper had proved irresistibly fascinating" (53). The term “wilderness" is generally used to refer to a that which is natural and unaffected by humanity. By using the phrases “found him out," “taken on him a terrible vengeance," and “whispered to him" Marlow is referring to “the wilderness" as an living entity which is consciously acting on Kurtz. Thus Marlow uses the word “wilderness" as a symbol for the effect of a place without laws on Kurtz. After being in an environment ungoverned by the rules of the civilization, Kurtz found himself going unpunished when acting on his desires. This led Kurtz to explore increasingly darker desires taking him down a path of self-discovery he would have never ventured if he had not been in such a place. Here Marlow is implying that when put in an atmosphere of lawlessness people discover darkness in themselves never before imagined. This idea is delivered early in Marlow's narrative when he tells of the circumstances in which the previous steamboat captain died. Marlow tells his audience that the captain was known to be “the gentlest, quietest creature that ever walked on two legs" before going to Africa (6). After the captain had been there for a couple of years he was killed after brutally beating the chief of a local tribe over some hens. This shows that the captain, after living in a situation where the unchecked indulgence of desires is permissible, deviated from his peaceful ways.

A connection to the struggle in maintaining self-control is suggested when Marlow says, “It echoed loudly within him because he was hollow at the core" (53). The phrase “echoed loudly" works to enhance the phrase “hollow at the core." Both words in the phrase “echoed loudly" have connotations involving sound. The phrase “hollow at the core" also invokes a link to sound as many musical instruments have a hollow core. The word “it" refers to the word “whisper" in the previously quoted sentence. The intensity of sound associated with a whisper contrasts greatly with the magnitude implied by the phrase “echoed loudly." Here the whisper symbolizes the desires of Kurtz. Marlow describes Kurtz as “hollow at the core" because he lacks the ability to invoke restraint upon himself. Intensity here represents the magnitude of Kurtz's desire to satisfy his dark indulgences. The emptiness of Kurtz's provides a place for this magnitude to become large. Kurtz's emptiness allows his desire to fulfill his plans in obtaining ivory to consume him. This is in some ways analogous to how emptiness in Marlow is slowly filled with the desire to meet Kurtz.

After Marlow tells of his discovery of the heads outside of Kurtz's home, he gives a monologue that leads the reader toward several ideas implied in his narrative. The careful analysis of this passage captures a connection to Marlow's beliefs about imperialism as result of his his experiences in Africa; the hypocrisy of the manager and imperialism in general; the uncovering of the mystery behind Kurtz; restraint and the slippery slope of savagery; the question of conscious knowledge of one's loss of self-control; the lure of unrestricted fulfillment of desire; and the struggle in maintaining self-control.
