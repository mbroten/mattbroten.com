The article, "Language, Embodiment, and the Cognitive Niche" by Andy Clark, was selected because it closely relates to my interests in cognitive and computer science. Within the field of computer science I am most fascinated with artificial intelligence and the prospective of self-learning, conscious machines. Although I am interested in several aspects of artificial intelligence, the one most intriguing to me is known as  natural language processing, the process of getting a computer to understand and produce natural human language. I believe the key to implementing a computer system that is able to fully achieve the goal of natural language processing, and ultimately self-awareness, lies in the study of the human brain and its use of language. Hence, my interest in cognitive science is focused largely around language. After reading several articles, this one in particular seemed to be the perfect fit for the further elaboration of my thinking on such topics.

In this article Clark seeks to explore the cognitive role of language. The theme of his presentation is that language acts to provide a "thought-enabling cognitive niche," a structure that aids in the "thinking and reasoning about some target domain or domains." He suggests that language forms the thinking process. This view differs from the "Pure Translation" view, where language merely serves as a representation, or "vessel of content," of the inner workings of the mind.

To make a case for this position, Clark presents three notion that expand upon his view that language is an aspect of thought. First, he contends that labeling "creates for the learner a new realm of perceptible objects upon which to target more basic capacities of statistical and associative learning." He cites evidence from the study of symbol trained chimpanzees that the presence of tags or labels "alters the computational burdens involved in certain kinds of learning and problem-solving." In this he asserts that language allows for faster learning and a greater ability to reason. Second, Clark suggests that language is used to enhance precise mathematical thought. Humans have a biological ability to understand small quantities and magnitudes, but language provides the "capacity to to think about an unlimited set of exact quantities." Thus, language allows for forms of reasoning that would otherwise not be possible. Third, he proposes that language is "a key cognitive tool enabling us to objectify, reflect upon, and hence knowingly engage with, our own thoughts, trains of reasoning, and personal cognitive characters." He contends that language is an augmentation to human brain that allows for the formulation of thought in words to create objects which can be in turn thought about. Clark proposes that "the process of linguistic formulation creates the stable attendable structure to which subsequent thinkings can attach." Hence, language provides the means for progressively expansive symbolic thinking.

Additionally, Clark suggests a computation framework to enable his view of language. He suggests that the three notions that support his view propose a framework where language and its relation to thought enhance the lower-level functions of the brain "acting to stabilize and discipline intrinsically fluid and context-sensitive modes of thought and reason." This system works in a way such that new information is influenced by similar preexisting information, and the retrieval of information is based largely on context. He states that "words and linguistic strings are among the most powerful and basic tools that we use to discipline and stabilize dynamic processes of reason and recall." Through the use of language, Clark proposes that we guide and shape our thoughts through processes of learning, recall, and selective attention.

Lastly, Clark suggests a refinement to the notion of the Central Executive or "Central Meaner" that is helpful but non-essential to his perspective of language.  He states that "in place of such an all-knowing inner executive, we should consider the possibility of a vast parallel coalition of more-or-less influential forces whose largely self-organizing unfolding makes each of us the the thinking being we are." He purposes that the idea of a single central reasoning engine that molds thought into language for expressive purposes should be instead represented as a distributed system where language emerges as interacting parts of the system itself.

The theme presented in the article is an important and appealing area of research. Many consider language to primarily be a structure of communication. Clark looks beyond this view of language. Here language is presented as a structure which acts as a cognitive enhancement facilitating more than what would be possible with the biological structures of the brain alone.   Clark's perspective provides an interesting insight to how important language is to our ability to think the way we do.  His view explains how language allows the brain to formulate complex abstract concepts that can be reflected and expanded upon. He provides new reason to look into the way language allows us to materialize and manipulate our thinking. Clark's first supporting idea offers an interesting perspective on how language facilitates the ability to reason and learn in ways not otherwise possible without great effort. Understanding more about this could provide insight on the mechanisms of learning and problem solving.  His second supporting idea, which illustrates how language provides a key asset in the ability to achieve precise mathematical thought, could offer a greater understanding of our ability to symbolically represent the precise abstracts ideas found throughout the disciplines of engineering, science, and mathematics. Clark's third notion, which suggests that language provides the means to evaluate our own thinking and the thinking of others, potentially could answer questions about the highest levels of our cognitive abilities and the emergence of self-aware conscious thought. This last point is particularly important to the field of artificial intelligence in furthering the development of intelligent machines who have ability to think the way humans do.

Clark's research provides many opportunities for further investigation. His work inspires several research questions. How exactly does our neural system support the cognitive role of language? How different is our internal use of language from our primarily communication oriented external use of language? How limited is our underlying neural system in the formulation of thought without language? Clark's position also calls for further exploration on an experimental basis. Although much could be learned from experiments involving humans who have not been exposed to language, finding participants who meet this criteria would be quite a challenge. Thus, more creative experimental studies would have to be developed. One way to avoid this issue is to study non-human primates. Unfortunately, this mostly limits the scope of the experiment to Clark's first supporting notion which already cites experimentation involving the use of chimpanzees. To expand the empirical evidence that has already been cited by Clark in this regard, a study could be set up to examine the differences in problem solving and learning abilities exhibited between non-human primates who have been trained to use language and those who have not. This would not be as ideal as an experiment involving humans, but important evidence involving the impact of language on reasoning and learning could still be gleaned. One might argue that the premise of the experiment is flawed. Non-human primates do not show the ability to naturally acquire language the way humans do, so perhaps they do not have the underlying neural structure that is able to support the full cognitive enhancement provided by language. However, even though primates may not have a neural system that can support automatic language acquisition, they can still benefit from language training as cited by Clark. Thus, the experiment would still be valuable in providing supportive evidence even though it is not perfect. Additional studies focused around Clark's other supporting ideas could also be developed; however, these studies would probably have to creatively invoke evidence through tests involving humans regardless of their exposure to language. Additionally, many possibilities are likely to be presented to study of the cognitive role of language  as non-invasive neural scanning systems become increasingly more sophisticated.
